# Android Graph Demo

## Overview
Simple android application that allows a user to draw a graph. The
application will display two views to the user. A main view for
the user to interact and draw with -- this view will only display
a portion of the canvas to the user, and can be scrolled and
navigated by the user when swiping. And a smaller view, which is
a scaled down version of the main view displaying the entire canvas
as well as the users current location on the canvas.
